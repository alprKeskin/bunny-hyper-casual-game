# bunny-hyper-casual-game
This project is a game project created using OpenGL and GLFW. I have used C++ as the programming language.
Basicaly, there is a bunny jumping constantly. The rabbit is trying to escape from the obstacles in front of him.
It spins with joy every time it passes a set of obstacles. As the game progresses, the speed of the game increases.
